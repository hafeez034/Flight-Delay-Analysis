# Flight-Delay-Analysis

### Power BI Dashboard Insights â€“ Flight Delay Analysis

This Power BI dashboard provides an in-depth analysis of flight delays, cancellations, and the performance of various airlines based on key metrics. Below is a technical summary of the findings:

#### 1. **Flight Departure and Arrival Delays**
- **On-Time Departure, Delayed Arrivals**: Airports like ATL, ORD, and DFW experience the highest numbers of on-time departures but delayed arrivals, with ATL leading at **29K flights** arriving late despite leaving on time.
- **Airline Delays**: Airlines such as **Southwest Airlines** and **Delta Air Lines** face substantial delays, with **615K** and **533K** delayed flights, respectively. This highlights operational inefficiencies, especially in handling connecting flights and turnaround times.

#### 2. **Flight Cancellations**
- **Top Airlines for Cancellations**: **Southwest Airlines** has the highest number of flight cancellations at **5.9K**, followed by **Atlantic Southeast Airlines** at **3.1K**. This could indicate issues with fleet management or external factors such as weather.
- **Weather-Related Cancellations**: The dashboard also tracks cancellations due to adverse weather conditions, with **Chicago** and **Dallas-Fort Worth** airports showing the highest percentages of weather-related disruptions, with **22.46%** and **16.89%** respectively.

#### 3. **Distance Analysis**
- **Maximum and Minimum Distances**: The analysis of flight distances by airline reveals that **Virgin America** and **Spirit Airlines** cover the most extended flight distances, with some routes exceeding **5.0K miles**. This provides valuable insights into airline route efficiency and potential areas for optimization.
  
#### 4. **Flight Pair Rankings**
- **Top Origin-Destination Pairs**: The busiest flight routes are **SFO-LAX** (Rank 1 with **13,744** flights) and **LAX-SFO** (Rank 2 with **13,457** flights), followed by cross-country routes like **JFK-LAX**. Ranking routes by the total number of flights provides insights into high-demand routes and can aid in resource allocation and scheduling optimization.
  
#### 5. **Key Metrics Summary**
- **Total Flights**: The dataset includes a total of **5,332,914 flights**, with **61.29%** of them departing on time.
- **Delay Percentage**: **37.14%** of flights were delayed, indicating a need for better operational management.
- **Cancellations**: **1.64%** of flights were canceled, with a significant portion due to **late aircraft delays**.

### Conclusion
This dashboard effectively visualizes flight performance data, highlighting significant insights into delays, cancellations, and flight patterns across major airlines and airports. The insights generated can assist in improving airline performance, optimizing route management, and identifying areas prone to weather-related disruptions.
